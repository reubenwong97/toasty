# Toasty

**Current status: Incubating - Toasty is not ready for production usage. The API
is still evolving and documentation is lacking.**

Toasty is an ORM for the Rust programming language that prioritizes ease-of-use.
It supports both SQL databases as well as some NoSQL databases, including DynamoDB
and Cassandra. Note that Toasty does not hide the database capabilities.
Instead, Toasty exposes features based on the target database.

## Using Toasty

Projects that use toasty create a schema file to define the application's data
model. Here is the schema file from the
[hello-toasty](examples/hello-toasty/schema.toasty) example:

```rust
model User {
    #[key]
    #[auto]
    id: Id,

    name: String,

    #[unique]
    email: String,

    todos: [Todo],

    moto: Option<String>,
}

model Todo {
    #[key]
    #[auto]
    id: Id,

    #[index]
    user_id: Id<User>,

    #[relation(key = user_id, references = id)]
    user: User,

    title: String,
}
```

Using the Toasty CLI tool, you will generate all necessary Rust code for working
with this data model. The generated code for the above schema is
[here](examples/hello-toasty/src/db).

Then, you can easily work with the data model:

```rust
// Create a new user and give them some todos.
let user = User::create()
    .name("John Doe")
    .email("john@example.com")
    .todo(Todo::create().title("Make pizza"))
    .todo(Todo::create().title("Finish Toasty"))
    .todo(Todo::create().title("Sleep"))
    .exec(&db)
    .await?;

// Load the user from the database
let user = User::find_by_id(&user.id).get(&db).await?

// Load and iterate the user's todos
let mut todos = user.todos().all(&db).await.unwrap();

while let Some(todo) = todos.next().await {
    let todo = todo.unwrap();
    println!("{:#?}", todo);
}
```

## SQL and NoSQL

Toasty supports both SQL and NoSQL databases, including Cassandra and DynamoDB.
However, it does not aim to abstract the database. Instead, Toasty leans into
the target database's capabilities and aims to help the user avoid issuing
innefficient queries for that database.

When targetting both SQL and NoSQL databases, Toasty generates query methods
(e.g. `find_by_id` only for access patterns that are indexed). When targetting a
SQL database, Toasty might allow arbitrary additional query constraints. When
targetting a NoSQL database, Toasty will only allow constraints that the
specific target database can execute. For example, with DynamoDB, query methods
might be generated based on the table's primary key, and additional constraints
may be set for the sort key.

## Application data model vs. database schema

Toasty decouples the application datamodel from the database's schema. By
default, a toasty application schema will map 1-1 with a database schema.
However, additional annotations may be specified to customize how the
application data model maps to the database schema.

For example, the [crate-hub](examples/cratehub/schema.toasty) examples shows how
to map multiple application models to a single database table.

```rust
table user_and_packages {
    model User {
        #[key]
        #[auto]
        id: Id,

        name: String,

        #[unique]
        email: String,

        packages: [Package],
    }

    #[key(partition = user_id, local = id)]
    model Package {
        #[relation(key = user_id, references = id)]
        user: User,

        user_id: Id<User>,

        #[auto]
        id: Id,

        name: String,
    }
}
```

## Current status and roadmap

Toasty is still in the early development stages and is considered
**incubating**. There is no commitment to on-going maintenance or development.
At some point in the future, as the project evolves, this may change. As such,
we encourage you to explore, experiment, and contribute to Toasty, but do not
try using it in production.

Immediate next steps for the project are to fill obvious gaps, such as implement
error handling, remove panics throughout the code base, support additional data
types, and write documentation. After that, development will be based on
feedback and contribution.
